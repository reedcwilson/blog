<p><img src="http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/378348/big-brother.jpg" alt="big brother"></p>

<p>As one of the most acclaimed works of English literature, I would foolishly give 1984 a poor rating. I thought that George Orwell did a masterful job of creating a magnificently depressing world. Understanding that he wrote this story shortly after World War 2 and seeing Nazi Fascism and Soviet Socialism provides a good context to appreciate the severity of main character Winston Smith's world. Winston does all that he can to maintain what he thinks is sanity. His efforts at subterfuge lead him to his inevitable doom of brainwashing. No one can stand against the party. All will ultimately love "Big Brother." </p>

<p>One of the main concepts in 1984 is the the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink">doublethink</a>. While this seems impossible to maintain in practice, many people, if not all of us, see doublethink in our <a href="http://agreenroad.blogspot.com/2014/08/doublethink-in-history-and-present-day.html">every day lives</a>. Orwell's future is more than 30 years in our past; however, his warnings speak louder to us now than even his futuristic concept of 1984.</p>

<p>While I appreciate this piece of literature as a wonderfully written narrative on the effects of socialism and totalitarianism governments, the story didn't resonate with me. I appreciate the warnings offered by this novel but found myself thoroughly depressed while reading it. This book has undoubtedly enriched my life and I now have a higher cultural IQ but I cannot allow myself to give this book a four or five because of the way I felt while reading it.</p>
