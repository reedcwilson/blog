<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has held semi-annual conferences for 184 years. Until recently, each conference has had between five and ten speakers who teach and bear testimony of Jesus Christ. The Internet has made it so thousands can share their testimonies and beliefs simultaneously with the prophets and leaders they sustain. Twitter, Facebook, blogs and many other platforms make it possible to speak out. Although many people have interesting comments and positions, the main reason I watch the general conference is to hear from these inspired men of experience. I do not care as much about the opinions of perfect strangers. A summary of the most interesting or liked comments would be much more interesting than distracting me throughout the talks I am giving my time to hear. For now I am happy to remain part of the audience.</p>
